# TechDegree-FSJS-Project-2
 Data Pagination and Filtering

The application contains information for 42 students, including a name, email, and a picture. Using vanilla JavaScript to display the first nine students on the page, add page navigation(pagination buttons) a user can click to display different pages of students. The application works with a list of any number of students which means it is flexible enough to handle arrays of student data of various lengths. For this project, I coded using plain vanilla JavaScript without using jQuery or any other libraries, plugins, or code snippets for any aspect of this project, including the pagination.
